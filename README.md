# TwilightPrincessDungeonModel

This is my first CNN Image Classification Model.
There need to be some tweaks done, and due to file size issues, you must create your own data file.
I added the data I used to this repository, but I suggest you create your own. I ran into some issues due to the differences in the lighting of the HD and SD versions.

Some things I could change is to add more data as well as keep the data as consistent as possible.

I plan to come back to this model, but here are the current metrics. The x-axis represents the number of epochs I used (20).

Accuracy ✅:

Loss ❌:

This model will currently reach about a 97% accuracy rate, but here are some suggestions:
For guessing Temple of Time, input images from the HD version of the game.
The rest you can use SD, though Hyrule Castle sometimes benefits from this as well.
